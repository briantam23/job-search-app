In this role you will work on the best teams to help the best organizations in the world – in private, public, and social sectors – solve their most difficult problems. You will also work with many experts, from data scientists and researchers to software and app designers.</p><p>If you are interested in joining a specific practice, please indicate this in your office/practice preference (combinations are possible). Internship opportunities vary by office, so please check with your campus recruiter to determine what possibilities are available if you have questions.  If you are not working directly with a campus recruiter, you may check with the office of interest to learn more.</p><p>To learn more about how we help our clients and where you fit in, visit our <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/careers/home\" target=\"_blank\">careers site</a>. </p>",

Associate Interns receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on their teams. This support includes a Partner from your local office or practice assigned to you to help guide your career as well as formal training in your first few weeks as an intern. Additionally, you&#39;ll receive guidance and support from your local office or practice in the selection of client projects, helping you to develop your skills and build your network.</p><p>While all consultants develop specialized knowledge and a focused program as they progress with McKinsey, most are initially very broad in their focus, meaning they do not need specific industry or functional expertise to be successful. For consultants who join McKinsey as experienced professionals, this can mean building on previous knowledge or developing unique experience in an area that is completely new. You will likely intersect with many elements of our firm&#39;s work including Digital McKinsey, Implementation, and New Ventures - either by collaborating on teams or working with colleagues from these groups.",
